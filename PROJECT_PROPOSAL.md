## Non-Technical Overview

### üéØ **What Problem Are We Solving?**

Software teams struggle to understand their codebase health. Questions like "Which packages change the most?", "How fast is our development?", "Where should we focus refactoring efforts?" are hard to answer manually. Traditional tools are complex and require technical expertise.

### üöÄ **Our Solution**

GitIntel: AI-Powered Git Repository Analysis Tool
Project Description
Analyzing large Java GitHub repositories can be challenging due to thousands of commits, hundreds of files, and complex package structures. GitIntel simplifies this process by providing AI-assisted analysis tools that extract structured data about code churn, package-level activity, and complexity metrics. Using natural language commands, users can generate comprehensive Excel reports that help understand repository evolution and code quality patterns.

Problem Statement & Objectives
Understanding the evolution of large Java software projects requires specialized knowledge and significant time investment. Developers, researchers, and project managers need efficient ways to track package changes, assess code complexity, and analyze development patterns without manually processing Git history. Existing tools either provide raw data requiring deep technical expertise or lack the performance needed for large repositories.

The main objective of GitIntel is to provide an accessible, AI-enhanced platform that automatically analyzes Java Git repositories and delivers structured insights in Excel format. It aims to help users monitor code quality, understand package evolution, and make informed decisions through natural language commands with intelligent performance optimization.

Proposed Solution
GitIntel leverages PyDriller for Git repository mining and Google Gemini AI for natural language command processing. It extracts key metrics such as package-level code churn, lines of code analysis, cyclomatic complexity, and time-based development ratios. The tool supports direct GitHub repository cloning, commit range limiting for performance, and generates professional Excel reports. Users can interact through simple commands like "package churn first 500 commits" or Bengali equivalents, with automatic fallback parsing when AI services are unavailable. Future enhancements may include developer contribution analysis and visualization capabilities.

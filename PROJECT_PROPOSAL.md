## Non-Technical Overview

### üéØ **What Problem Are We Solving?**

Software teams struggle to understand their codebase health. Questions like "Which packages change the most?", "How fast is our development?", "Where should we focus refactoring efforts?" are hard to answer manually. Traditional tools are complex and require technical expertise.

### üöÄ **Our Solution**

GitIntel is an AI-powered tool that lets anyone analyze code repositories using simple, natural language commands in Bengali or English. Just type "‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá 500+ line changes ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶ì" and get instant Excel reports!
